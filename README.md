The field of molecular biology is set to see the growth in demand over the next 10 years of up to 19% which is much higher than average compared to other industries. Therefore, choosing to study molecular biology can be a wise career move as you won’t be likely to struggle finding a job once you graduate. It is not impossible to find an entry-level jobs with a master’s or even bachelor degree, but if you want to advance in this industry, you will need higher degrees in order to work in labs, run experiments, or conduct research.

There are a lot of niches in this sector, specially NSG, STEMCELL or BIODATA ANALYSIS (BIOINFORMATICS). Bioinformatic is a new sector combinate in computer science and biology. In order to teach yourself how to do Bioinformatics, it is important you start with learning a programming language If you are not familiar with programming already. Then you can begin reading data and running statistics, as well as completing a project where you put your findings together.

It is important to note that Bioinformatic is a very large field, so if you are interested in self-learning, then maybe this is for you.
