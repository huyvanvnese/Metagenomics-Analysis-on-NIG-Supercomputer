Concentration of virus samples with hollow-fiber UF membrane

Concentration of virus using hollow-fiber UF is now considered 
as a preferential method for simulateous recoery of pathogens in water, bacterial, protozoa and virus.
Blocking the membrane surface using protein rich solution (such as FBS) before the filtration process, adding dispersant
into sample. Among them, blocking by FBS overnight seems to improve the recovery greatly.

Elution/ back flushing with a dispersant consists of NaPP + Tween 80 (surfactant) + antifoam also seems to have additional effect.

THE PROCEDURE 
1) Add 10ml of FBS to Milli-Q water to abtain 5% FBS
2) Connect UF module, tube and rotary pump
3) Rotare 5% FBS for 1 min with 1L/ min flow rate.
4) Stop pumping and replace the cap of UF module in order to 5% FBS remains in the module.
5) Incubate the UF module overnight at the room temperature. 5% FBS in the module needs to be extruded out just before the concentration process.
6) Leave UF module at ambient temperature overnight (Leave FBS solution in module)
